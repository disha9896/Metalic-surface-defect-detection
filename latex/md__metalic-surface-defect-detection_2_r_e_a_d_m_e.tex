 The goal of this project is to develop an automated inspection process with precise localization of the defects on the metallic surface for example coffee machine, microwave and other small appliances. The defects that can appear are of many types such as dents, scratches or stains, burns, rust or cracks on the metallic surface. Currently we will be focusing on coffee machine to detect defects.\hypertarget{md__metalic-surface-defect-detection_2_r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Dataset}{Dataset}}\label{md__metalic-surface-defect-detection_2_r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}
Training of the defect detection was done using the kaggle dataset which can be downloaded using this link \href{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alex000kim/gc10det}{\texttt{ https\+://www.\+kaggle.\+com/datasets/alex000kim/gc10det}}. Scratch detection dataset was downloaded from \href{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fantacher/neu-metal-surface-defects-data/data}{\texttt{ https\+://www.\+kaggle.\+com/datasets/fantacher/neu-\/metal-\/surface-\/defects-\/data/data}} this dataset did not have labels so need to annotate them.

A sample dataset from the original dataset is stored in the dataset folder which is divided into train, test and valid folder. It also contains the labels(annotations) and data.\+yml file which help to locate the images and the labels for training.

This sample dataset will help to train a sample model.\hypertarget{md__metalic-surface-defect-detection_2_r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Setup Instructions}{Setup Instructions}}\label{md__metalic-surface-defect-detection_2_r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Make sure you have python installed in your system
\item Install required libraries by running following code. requirements.\+txt file present in the repository 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{pip\ install\ -\/r\ requirements.txt\ }

\end{DoxyCode}

\item Install git lfs to use the large files i.\+e. models in the repository. Homebrew\+: {\ttfamily brew install git-\/lfs} Mac\+Ports\+: {\ttfamily port install git-\/lfs}

Then pull from the git repo using the command \+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{git\ lfs\ pull}

\end{DoxyCode}

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item defect\+\_\+detection file contains the class to train the model and do model prediction.
\item Dataset folder contains sample images and labels to train the model.
\item results folder stores the results after prediction.
\item after training runs/train contains the trained model and validations.
\item Validation\+\_\+results folder contains the graphs and predicted images of the trained model of best.\+pt
\item Model folder contains best.\+pt file which is the model to detect the defects.
\item Yolov9e.\+pt is the pre-\/trained model in the model folder which is used to train the new custome model.

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Open train\+\_\+demo.\+py file.
\item Add the dataset directory path.(Ignore this if you want to use the default path)
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Load the pre-\/trained yolov9e.\+pt model from the model folder.
\item Run the train function to train the model.
\item It will store the validation resuls, detected results and the model in the run/detect/train folder.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Note -\/ If training on cpu this process will take time so don\textquotesingle{}t run for more than 1 epoch.

Use the best.\+pt model to predict results as it is trained properly with all the images the dataset here is just a sample dataset for you to try and train the model whole dataset link is provided above. The training for complete dataset requires GPU and takes more time to train.\hypertarget{md__metalic-surface-defect-detection_2_r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Testing}{Testing}}\label{md__metalic-surface-defect-detection_2_r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md5}
There are 4 test in total.
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Video\+\_\+testing.\+py (mimicking the real scenario)
\item prediction.\+py (predict single image)
\item predict\+\_\+multiple.\+py (predicts mutiple images)
\item train\+\_\+demo.\+py (which contains the training code)
